I used my 10x15x1 inch jelly roll pan as per instructions and disaster struck!! I actaully tried it again, to make sure \"I\" didnt screw up my measurements on ingredients or the pan size..my husband watched and double checked for me even!! It overflowed again ( this time I put foil down in the oven just in case ) I was sooo craving these and they DID smell wonderful :) I am going to use my 11x17x1 inch sheet pan next time!",

The second time she made them I made a Philly Cream Cheese Frosting instead of the canned and it was wonderful.  This is most defently making it my sister's table for Thanskgiving.  Nancy",

It was an instant hit! Helpful hints: I added about 1\/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the batter, since the pumpkin pie filling is only mildly spiced. Also, after frosting the cake, place it in the refrigerator (or freezer) until the frosting is slightly hardened, this will keep the frosting firm around the edges when cutting the bars.",
